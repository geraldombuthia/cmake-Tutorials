# In summary
# Sets the minimum required version of CMake.
# Declares the project name as "cMakeLibraries".
# Creates an executable target named after the project (in this case, the project name is stored in ${PROJECT_NAME}).
# Adds the subdirectory "Adder" which contains the library's CMakeLists.txt file.
# Ensures that the adder.h header can be included using a simple #include <adder.h> directive.
# (Optional, but not commonly used) Specifies a directory for linking libraries (not necessary in this case).
# Links the "adder" library with the executable, making the library's functions/classes available to the executable.
